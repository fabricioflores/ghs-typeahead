# ghs-typeahead - [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) directives specific to [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)

***
## Why this is forked?

Bootstrap's Typeahead didn't fit our needs and purposes so we extended it so that it could

1 - Display the dropdown simply by clicking on the input box (Very useful if you want to display data that is already cached)
2 - Allow a ngDisabled field that made the row unclickable
3 - Allowed refreshing of the rendered dropdown without closing and opening it.
